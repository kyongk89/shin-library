          <p>Hello!
         </P>
         <p>
           My name is Seungho Shin and I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of New Orleans, teaching undergraduate classes in Intermediate Business Statistics, Financial Management, and Principles of Microeconomics. 
         </P>
         <p>
          I am also working on several research papers in the fields of corporate finance, asset pricing, and international finance. Prior to embarking on this wired, crazy, and wonderful journey, I graduated with an MBA in Finance and Operations Management from Crummer Graduate School of Business – Rollins College, and I received my bachelor’s degree in Finance at University of Central Florida.

	    <p><h1>Statements of Teaching Philosophy and Effectiveness</p></h1>
	 <p><u>Teaching Philosophy</p></u>
	<p>•	Integration of responsibilities: Teaching, research, and public service comprise the mission of university faculty. Accordingly, I apply insights shared with me by students and members of the business community to the development of research questions in my program of research. Moreover, I discuss state-of-the-art advances in the research literature (including in-press findings not yet available to the general public) and current events in the business world during presentations to both students and members of the business community.</p>
	<p>•	Expertise: I serve as instructor only of courses in which I have developed content expertise from both academical and practical experience as an applied researcher.
	<p>•	Relationships: A healthy relationship between the instructor and student is essential for an effective learning experience. I view my students as valued customers and future business colleagues and strive to treat them accordingly. Comments from student evaluations validate my respect and admiration for them and theirs for me.</p>
	<p>•	Learning environment: To effectively serve my students, I proactively and explicitly use as examples in classroom examples reflecting diversity in the classroom and in the world around us. I make an effort to respect students treat them with dignity and encourage their active participation.</p>
	<p>•	Methods: I ask each student in designated classes to make a summary article at least once a semester. Typically, these summaries require the students to analysis their mastery of course contents, as well as insights into real world situations of personal relevance. Moreover, they are required to exhibit mastery over analysis skills, such as the development of Microsoft Excel Spreads and express their opinions and thoughts in business management.</p>  
	<p>•	Outcomes: I expect my students to be positioned to leverage their newly acquired knowledge and insights to: (1) increase their competitive advantage in the workplace, and (2) enhance their quality of work and non–work life experiences through improved interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
	<p><u>Teaching Effectiveness</p></u>
	<p>•	Courses Taught: I have taught courses basic to the undergraduate business major (QMBE 2786 Intermediate Business and Economics Statistics, FIN 3300 Financial Management, and ECON 1203 Principles of Microeconomics).</p>
	<p>•	Outcomes: Like most faculty members, I receive from the teaching evaluation process my fair share of highly exaggerated positive comments from students. Some comments are below:</p>
<p>“Award winning personality!!  Connected immediately with his students. Extremely dedicated to his students, always offering his time for individual tutoring and answering questions for 12 or more hours a day.”</p> 

<p>“Subject matter expert.  His knowledge on the topic allowed him to answer what I felt were complex questions in a split second.”</p>

<p>“One of my all time favorite instructors. He is always available for questions and has a great feedback, cares about his students, will go over the topic over and over until the student understands. I will recommend him to other students.”</p>

<p>“I considered this to be the toughest class in my major and had major anxiety about taking it. Professor Shin eliminated my anxiety and it became a class I eagerly looked forward to. There's no doubt its a difficult topic and a lof of information to digest, but I think Mr. Shin's professional attitude and candid personality are all the improvement this course needed. I sure hope he teaches this class in the future, I hate to think I was one of a handful of "lucky ones" to learn from him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shin takes pride in his work. He devotes a lot of time in teaching, as well as, making sure we understand the material. I would recommend him to other students. He is one of the best instructors I have had at UNO so far.”</p>

<p>“The instructor was very nice and really wanted us to do well. Most of his lecture notes were very useful. He communicated via email clearly and often. He was always available if needed and had extensive office hours. He was very enthusiastic about teaching this class and seemed very knowledgeable. Great sense of humor.”</p>
